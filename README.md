# wcsv
A tool written in Rust to generate a CSV of info about all the countries in the world
# Usage
```
cargo run
```
Get the API key from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/) <br/>
You'll have an `apikey` file in the directory. <br/>
It'll fetch all the countries (this may take some time depending on your network speed) and it'll arrange them in a CSV called `world_countries_info.csv`.
